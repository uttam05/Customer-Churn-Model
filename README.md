# Customer-Churn-Model
Capstone Project

Captstone Project by Uttam Kushwaha

Used several Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression,Support Vector Machines,Decision Tree & Random Forest.

Here is what you need to see with respect to the steps followed->

1.Exploratory Data Analysis can be found in DataQualityReport.r

2.Preprocessing,Data analysis and visualization can be found in Customer_churn.r

3.Evaluation of models can be found in ROC_curve.jpeg and Impfactors.jpeg.

Results- Finally,Random Forest with tuned parameters was selected with optimal training/testing scores accross 10 folds of data.
